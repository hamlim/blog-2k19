# React Error Boundaries

The other week I got an email from a developer wondering if I could help them learn more about Error Boundaries within React.

I figured that instead of sharing that information directly to them, I would spend a bit more time writing it up in a blog post so others could learn from the content as well.

So lets dive in!

## What are Error Boundaries?

Simply put, you can think of Error Boundaries as `try ... catch` blocks within a component tree. This is an example of a try catch block:

```js
try {
  doSomethingThatMayThrow()
} catch (error) {
  handleError(error)
}
```

In that snippet above, the `doSomethingThatMayThrow` function can `throw` anything (generally an error) and the `catch` block
will capture this thrown value and continue script execution.

In React this would look like something like the following:

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <ComponentThatMayThrow />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

Great, so we have a rough understanding of what they look like in practice, but how do they actually work?

## How do Error Boundaries Work?

An error boundary can be implemented within any component that uses either the:

- `componentDidCatch` or
- `detDerivedStateFromError`

Both of these methods allow the component to catch an error thrown from within its children.
