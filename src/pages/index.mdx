# Hey ðŸ‘‹

Hey there, I'm Matt. I'm currently living and working in Boston. I am a Senior
Software Engineer working on the Frontend Design Systems team at Wayfair. In my
free time I like to work on several different
[side projects](https://github.com/hamlim), and somehow find time to write some
blog posts as well.

## Blog Posts

<BlogList
  nodes={props.data.allMdx.edges.filter(
    ({ node }) => !node.fields.slug.includes('legacy')
  )}
/>

## Old Posts

These are posts that may have many dead links, and in general might not have
much content worth reading.

<BlogList
  nodes={props.data.allMdx.edges.filter(({ node }) =>
    node.fields.slug.includes('legacy')
  )}
/>

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query blogIndex {
    allMdx {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          frontmatter {
            title
            publishDate
          }
          fields {
            slug
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
