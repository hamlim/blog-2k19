# Starting Fresh

I think over the past two years I have attempted to redesign my personal site about 3 or 4 times. Since I am taking off two weeks from work I decided to go for number 4 or 5 and start anew again.

This time I am giving Gatsby another go, with the long term vision of moving this over to my own home rolled solution that will use my `@native-bundler` project to bundle the javascript.
